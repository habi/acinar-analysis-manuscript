## Results

The number of alveoli per acinus was assessed for 268 individual acini throughout postnatal lung development at days 4, 10, 21 and 60.
For day 4, we analyzed 125 acini, for day 10 we analyzed 58 acini, for
day 21 we analyzed 42 acini, and for day 60 we analyzed 43 acini.
To get started, we show an overview of our process in figure @fig:1. Panels A-D show a representative light
microscopy image for each assessed time point. Panels E-H of figure @fig:1 each correspond to one slice of the
tomographic data sets acquired at TOMCAT. Panels I-L of figure @fig:1 show the middle slice of the datasets
used for the stereological analysis of the extracted acini. The acinus is shown in light gray as an overlay
over the tomographic data.

### Alveoli per acinus

The average entrance ring count, which corresponds to the number of alveoli per acinus for the 125 acini
at day 4 is 48±41 alveoli. For the 58 acini at day 10 it is 89±84 alveoli, for the 42 acini at day 21 it is
233±164 alveoli. At day 60 we assessed 43 acini in total, on average they have 702±219 alveoli.

The values for the single animal are given in table @tbl:counts and plotted in figure @fig:02.

The alveolar number shows highly signiﬁcant differences (Šidák-corrected p-value < 0.00167 (44)) between all possible combination of days.
All possible combinations of entrance ring counts per day are significantly different (all p-values are better than p=1.9e-5, which is the p-value of the difference between days 4 and 10). The entrance ring counts for all animals are independent (p=1.6e-34).

### Acinus volume

The stereological assessment resulted in a mean acinar volume of 0.03±0.04 mm<sup>3</sup> for the 125 acini at
day 4. For the 58 acini at day 10 we get a volume of 0.04±0.05 mm<sup>3</sup>. For the 42 acini at day 21 a volume
of 0.10±0.09 mm<sup>3</sup> and for the 43 acini at day 60 a volume of 0.74±0.37 mm<sup>3</sup>.

The values for the single animals are shown in table @tbl:volumes and displayed in figure @fig:3. The mean volume of the
20 % smallest acini to the 20 % largest acini at day 4 increases 27.47 times (from 0.0035 μl to 0.095 μl,
N=25). At day 10, this increase is 15.28 times (from 0.0071 μl to 0.11 μl, N=12). At day 21, this increase
is 14.42 times (from 0.018 μl to 0.26 μl, N=8). At day 60, we saw an increase of 3.94 times (from 0.33 μl
to 1.3 μl, N=9).

  The acinar volumes are all significantly different (all p-values better than 4.5e-6, which is the one between days 10 and 21) for each combination of days except between days 4 and 10 (p=0.08).](images/fig03.png){#fig:03}

The acinar volumes show highly signiﬁcant differences between all possible combinations of days except
between days 4 and 10 (p=0.08). All other p-values are better than p=4.5e-6, which is the p-value for
the difference between days 10 and 21. The statistical analysis is equal to what is brieﬂy described
for the entrance ring count above. The acinar volumes for animals 21E and all animals of day 60 are
non-normally distributed, but all acinar volumes per animal are independent (p=5e-29).

### Alveoli per volume

The mean number of alveoli for the 125 acini at day 4 is 2166±1132 alveoli per mm<sup>3</sup> . For the 58 acini
at day 10 we counted 2831±1189 alveoli per mm<sup>3</sup>, for the 42 acini at day 21 2723±771 alveoli per mm<sup>3</sup>
and for the 43 acini at day 60 1080±349 alveoli per mm<sup>3</sup>. These numbers were found by dividing the
counted entrance rings by the acinus volumes.

The numbers for the single animals are shown in table @tbl:density and displayed in figure @fig:4.

![Number of alveoli per acinus volume. Left: linear scale, right: logarithmic scale. The number
of alveoli per acinus volume are all significantly different (all p-values are better than 5e-5, which is the

The counts per volume, which correspond to the number of alveoli per acinus volume are a value for
estimating the complexity of the single acini. This acinus complexity shows highly signiﬁcant differences
between all possible combinations of days except between days 10 and 21 (p=0.7). All other days have a
p-value better than p=5e-5, this being the one between days 4 and 21. The statistical analysis is equal
to what is brieﬂy described for the entrance ring count above. The counts per volume for all animals
except 04A are non-normally distributed, but all are independent (p=2.9e-21).

### Number of acini

229

The number of acini for day 4 was 18260±16555 acini, for day 10 14359±5611 acini, for day 21 11203±2681
acini and for day 60 4277±777 acini. These numbers were obtained by dividing the parenchymal volume
of the lungs (10) with the Cavalieri-estimated volume of the acini. To calculate these data we had to
use data of two different studies. Most likely due to error propagation, we observed a large standard
deviation. In the end the number of acini do not diﬀer significantly between the days and is not different
to the value published by Barre et al. (8).

### Total number of alveoli per lung

The total alveolar number for day 4 was found to be 0.64±0.34 million alveoli, for day 10 1.23±0.39
million alveoli, for day 21 2.65±0.57 million alveoli, and for day 60 3.01±0.58 million alveoli. The total
number of acini was estimated by dividing the mean parenchymal volume of the lungs (10), by the
shrinkage-corrected stereologically estimated acinar volume. The number of alveoli is then simply the
multiplication of the average entrance ring count with the estimated number of acini.

### Volume of individual alveoli

The mean volume of one alveolus for day 4 was 686151 μm<sup>3</sup>, for day 10 452285 μm<sup>3</sup>, for day 21 445373 μm<sup>3</sup>
and for day 60 1053526 μm<sup>3</sup>. This corresponds to an average diameter per alveolus of 109 μm, 95 μm,
95 μm, and 126 μm for days 4, 10, 21 and 60, respectively. The average volume of one alveolus was
estimated by dividing the mean acinar volume by the mean count of alveoli for each day separately.
The average diameter was estimated by assuming spherical alveoli and solving the volume equation of a
sphere to the diameter.
