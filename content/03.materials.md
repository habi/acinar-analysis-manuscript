## Materials & Methods
### Rat lung samples

In the present study, a superset of the animals described by Haberthür et al. (23) were used. Tschanz et
al. (10) described a biphasic formation of new alveoli on the same set of animals. The stereological analysis
presented here represents a part of the 3R-initiative (replacement, reduction, and refinement) (24) for
the ethical use and the reduction of the number of animals sacrificed for science.

Brieﬂy, we extracted the lungs of Sprague-Dawley rats after having deeply anesthetized them with a
mixture of medetomidine, midazolam, and fentanyl (25). The rats were euthanized by exsanguination
during the removal of the lung. The lungs were fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde by intratracheal instillation and kept under constant pressure (20 cm H2 O) during fixation to prevent recoiling of the tissue.
The samples were prepared for tomographic imaging by post-fixation with 1 % osmium tetroxide and
staining with 4 % uranyl acetate, as well as by dehydration in a graded series of ethanol and embedding
in paraﬃn. In total we assessed 12 animals, on postnatal days P4, P10, P21, and P60 (N=3 per day.
From now on, we will omit the postnatal prefix and only mention the day.).

The animals were housed in the central animal facility of the University of Bern. They received food and
water ad libitum at a 12/12 hours day/night cycle. The experiments themselves, as well as the handling
of the animals before and during the experiments, were approved and supervised by the Federal Food
Safety and Veterinary Oﬃce of Switzerland and the Department of Agriculture and Nature of the Kanton
of Bern in Switzerland.

### Tomographic imaging

Tomographic imaging was performed at the TOMCAT beamline (26; 27) of the Swiss Light Source
at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. The samples were scanned at an X-ray energy
of 20.0 keV. After penetrating the sample, the X-rays were converted into visible light by either a
20-μm-thick LuAG:Ce or 18-μm-thick YAG:Ce scintillator screen (both from Crytur, Turnov, Czech
Republic), depending on the date of experiments. The resulting visible light was magnified using a 10times magnifying, diﬀraction-limited microscope lens and recorded with a 2048×2048 pixel CCD camera
(pco.2000, PCO, Kelheim, Germany) with 14 bits dynamic range operated in 2 by 2 binning mode. As a
result, in a single field of view, we were able to image a sample volume of a cube of 1.5 mm side length
with a voxel side length of 1.48 μm, with the exposure time of the single projections varying between
160 and 200 ms.
Since our samples were substantially larger than the field of view of the detector, we applied the socalled wide-field scanning method (28) to increase the field of view horizontally. For each sub-scan, we
recorded 3578 projections and laterally stitched them so that their combined field of view covered the
whole sample width. Additionally, two or three such wide-field scans were stacked vertically to match
the sample height.
The resulting data sets for each of the lung samples covered a field of view of a cube with approximately
4.5 mm side length which corresponds to an image stack with approximately 3000×3000×3000 pixels at
1.48 μm side length each. The mean size of the tomographic reconstructions, corresponding to the raw
data of each of the 42 analyzed tomographic scans is 8 GB, totaling to 336 GB.

### Extraction of acini

For the present manuscript, we extracted single acini from three-dimensional data, acquired without
destroying the samples. Details of this semi-automatic extraction of the rat acini are described by Haberthür et al. (23). We applied this protocol to extract 701 randomly selected acini throughout lung
development, at postnatal days 4, 10, 21 and 60. Individual acini were extracted from the tomographic
data with a custom image processing network established in MeVisLab (version 2.1, 2010-07-26 release, MeVis Medical Solutions and Fraunhofer MEVIS-Institute for Medical Image Computing, Bremen,
Germany).

This extraction was performed by segmenting the acinus volume with a gray-level threshold-based region
growing algorithm using manually placed seed points. To isolate individual acini in the data set we placed
disk-shaped segmentation stoppers at the acinus entrances. Each individual acinus was then exported as
a single DICOM file for portability. For each acinus, its exported DICOM file contained the segmented
acinus overlaid with the original background for further analysis. Example images from the DICOM files
are shown in the bottom row of Fig 1.

### Stereological analysis of alveolar characteristics

The stereological estimation of the alveolar number was performed according to the standards for quantitative assessment of lung structure from the American Thoracic Society (29) to guarantee accurate
and unbiased results. To perform the stereological analysis, each DICOM file from the isolated acini was
sampled into a systematic random set of single images using a MATLAB script (30).
The stereological assessment was performed with the STEPanizer (31), an easy-to-use software tool for
the stereological assessment of digital images. Details of the stereological assessment have previously
been described (32). Brieﬂy, we counted the appearance or disappearance of alveolar wall interruptions.
Under the assumption that these only occur in the region of the alveolar mouth opening and correspond
to alveolar entrance rings (33) we counted said interruptions on paired images spanning the whole acinus
volume. By using the disector method (34) we were thus able to estimate the number of alveoli in 268 of
the 701 exported acini. The acini we analyzed were subsampled from the full data by systematic uniform
random sampling (35). Brieﬂy, a defined fraction of the acini of one animal were analyzed, e.g. one third.
During segmentation, the acini were numbered. Based on these numbers every third acinus was selected,
randomly starting with the first, second, or third one.

Previously, we have shown that the stereological assessment of the acinar volume (according to the
Cavalieri principle (36)) gives comparable results to an automated volume extraction by counting the
segmented pixels in the tomographic data sets (32). Due to variations in the gray value, the automatic
segmentation underestimates the volume of the single acini. The best-suited approach to obtain unbiased
results is to asses the volume manually according to the Cavalieri principle, which is what we did for the
268 acini presented in this manuscript. The sets of JPG slices and the raw results from the stereological
analysis with the STEPanizer are available on request.

### Data analysis and display

All the stereologically assessed data was processed in a Jupyter (37) notebook, producing all the results,
including the statistical data and plots shown below. The notebook with all its history is freely available on
GitHub (38). The performed calculations are described in detail in section 3. In the plots, semitransparent
circles mark the single observations. The box shows the 25-75 % quartiles range of the data. The whiskers
extend to the rest of the distribution. Outliers are determined as a function of the inter-quartile range and
are shown outside the whiskers. Numerical values in the text are given as averages±standard deviation.
P-values in the text and figure legends are given as precise numbers, as suggested by Amhrein et al. (39).
Usually, we performed a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality (40) to test whether we can use an U-test
for assessing the differences, namely a two-sided Mann-Whitney rank test (41). This rank test was
used to assess the differences between the possible combinations. An additional Kruskal-Wallis H-test
for independent samples (42) was used to test for sample independence. The statistical analysis was
performed in the aforementioned notebook by using the statistical functions of the Scientific Computing
Tools for Python (43) or GraphPad Prism 7.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
