## Discussion

To our best knowledge, the present manuscript is the first to quantitatively describe the changes in the
volumes of single rat lung acini based on stereological analysis of a large number of individual acini.
In addition, we can easily estimate the number of acini during lung development from our data and
compare this to prior work. There are some limitations to our results though; for technical reasons, we
only assessed the acini in the lower medial tip of the right lower lung lobe. However, it was previously
shown that the right lower lobe is a valid sample for the entire lung (8) and that information drawn from
one lobe is representative for the whole lung (45). Furthermore, based on stereological data, Zeltner
et al. (45) were able to show that the lung parenchyma is quite homogeneous. Looking at individual
acini, Kizhakke Puliyakote et al. (21) observed that the peripheral, pleura facing acini possess an acinar
volume which is two thirds larger than the volume of the central ones. However, they did not report
additional regional differences, e.g. between acini located cranially and caudally. Own preliminary data
are indicative for the same result. We imaged an entire rat lung in situ immediately post mortem
using high resolution synchrotron radiation based X-ray tomographic microscopy (46). A first analysis
of regional difference show similar results as mentioned above. Therefore, we believe that our sample is
more than suitable for the drawn conclusions.

### Acinus volumes

The mean acinar volume significantly increases during lung development from postnatal days 10 to 60
with all p-values better than 4.5e-6. No significant difference was observed between postnatal days 4 and
10 (1.2×increase, p=0.08). A large part of the acinus volume increase happens after day 21 (compare
Fig. 3), which is consistent with previous literature (10; 1).

As mentioned in the introduction, Barré et al. (8) have shown that the number of acini remains constant during lung development.
This is somewhat surprising since the total lung volume increases by
roughly a factor of 11 during alveolarization. Therefore, we expect the mean volume of the acini to
increase by at least the same factor (8; 10).

We observed that the mean volume of acini increases 22.66 times between days 4 and 60 (p=1.8e-22) which
corresponds to an approximately 23 times increase of the total lung volume. The other combinations of
increases were: day 4 to day 21: 3.18×(p=1.3e-9), day 10 to day 21: 2.60×(p=4.5e-6), day 10 to day
60: 18.46×(p=1.4e-17), day 21 to day 60: 7.11×(p=7.1e-15). The increase from day 4 to day 10 was not
significant (p=0.08) at 1.23×).

During the same time, the coefficients of variation of the acinus volumes dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 but
the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20 % smallest and 20 % largest acini
decreased from a factor of 27.47 (day 4) to a factor of 3.94 (day 60). This indicates that the dispersion of
the value is based on an entirely different pattern of distribution of acinar sizes and that the difference of
the mean acinus volumes from the smallest to the largest fraction per day becomes smaller and smaller
during postnatal lung development.

When comparing the acinus volumes normalized to the largest volume per day, we found that the volumes
are closer together on day 4 and are spread out more on the other days (Fig. 5). Additionally, at days
4, 10 and 21 the distribution of the normalized volumes is skewed towards below the average (median of
normalized volumes at day 4: 0.16, at day 10: 0.18 and at day 21: 0.23), which means that we have more
smaller than larger acini early in the development. At day 60, the distribution is more homogeneous,
with the median of the normalized acinus volumes at exactly 0.50. This result let us speculate that acinar
growth is not constant during lung development. It seems that some acini increase their volume faster
than others. As a result we speculate that an increased percentage of acini is somehow dormant at day
4-21, while at day 60 most of the acini reached their final volume.

Figure 5: Normalized acinar volumes. The spread of the volumes is small early in the development and
skewed towards the lower end of the volumes. At day 60, the median is exactly in the middle of the
normalized volumes.

By dividing the parenchymal volumes of each lung estimated by Tschanz et al. (Table 1, (10)) by the
mean number of acini estimated by Barré et al. (9) we can estimate the mean acinar volume for each day.
The acinus volume we estimated by point counting (Cavalieri estimation) are on average 2.07 times lower
but show a similar increase over the studied period (data shown in supplementary Fig. 7).It appears that
the comparison between data obtained by stereology based on classical paraﬃn sections or on any kind of
3D-imaging has it limitation if it comes to the absolute numbers. First, due to the coast of Britain-eﬀect
the exact value of every surface measurement is depending on the resolution of the imaging method (47).
Second, the thickness of the alveolar septa in 3D-imaging data is heavily depending on the segmentation
between airspace and tissue - regardless if it is done manually or by a computed algorithm. We observed
that the airspace volumes obtained by 3D-imaging has a tendency to be smaller than the ones determined
using classical paraﬃn sections. However, the relative numbers obtained in one study match the ones of
other studies quite well.

### Acinus complexity, alveoli per volume

The volume and shape of the alveoli, alveolar ducts, and the acini are critical parameters for ventilation
and particle deposition (48; 49; 50). Particle deposition, for example, is relatively low during the first two
weeks of a rats’ life, high at postnatal day P21 and medium at days P36-P90 (13; 12). This correlates well
with our results, where we found a significantly larger acinus complexity (number of alveoli per acinus
volume) at days 10 and 21 compared to days 4 and 60 (p-values all better than 5.4e-5, which is the one
for day 4 vs. day 21). Kreyling et al. (13) report a maximal retention of gold nanoparticles at this time
point (see their Fig. 1).

Tschanz et al. (10) stereologically estimated the mean total acinar volume as the sum of ductal and
alveolar air spaces. The mean volume of the individual alveoli was found to be smallest around postnatal
day 21 (see their Fig. 4). We thus postulate a high acinar complexity at days 10 and 21 while early and
late in the lung development, the acinar complexity is relatively low. This also correlates with structural
changes. In rats, the alveolar air spaces are large during the first two weeks of life, small at day P21 and
medium afterward (10).

### Number of acini

Previously, it was shown that the number of acini remains constant during postnatal lung development
from day 4 to 60 (8), with a mean of 5612±547 acini per lung. Based on the acinar and parenchymal
volume we calculated the number of acini and were able to verify the previously reported result.

### Total alveolar number

In this study, we assessed the number of alveoli per acinus. The alveolar number we get (0.64±0.34,
1.23±0.39, 2.65±0.57, 3.01±0.58 million alveoli for days 4, 10, 21 and 60, respectively) have to be seen in
the context of the results shown by Tschanz et al. (0.823±0.01, 3.538±1.26, 14.303±3.08 and 19.297±3.06
million alveoli, (10), Table 1). On average, our results are five times smaller but show the same trend
when linearly corrected with a factor of 5.04. The values from Tschanz et al. overlap well with our linearly
scaled values, as seen in Fig. 6.

As shown in a study of Osmanagic et al. (51) the total alveolar number shows a large variability between
different labs. E.g. the reported total number of alveoli in adult C57BL6 mice diﬀers by a factor of
approximately 8. These studies were all performend in labs well-known for their quality of stereologybased investigations of lung morphology. Therefore, any simple bias or methodical error may not account
for the reported differences. It seems to be that the total number of alveoli is dependent on unknown small
methodical differences. However, the relative numbers are surely reliable, especially, if the comparison
is done in groups of animals processed in parallel and counted by the same operator. We assessed the
same lungs as Tschanz et al. (10), but based on a very different imaging method and with two different
persons performing the stereological assessment. The latter two points may explain the factor of 5.04.

### Volumes of individual alveoli

By dividing the alveolar air space by the number of alveoli we can estimate a mean alveolar volume of
5.91e5 μm3 for day 4, of 2.49e5 μm3 for day 10, of 1.34e5 μm3 for day 21, and 2.93e5 μm3 for day 60.

Figure 6: Number of alveoli based on data from Tschanz et al. (10) together with our linearly scaled data
(our data multiplied by 5.04). Values are plotted with a band of the width of their standard deviation.

On average, our values are 2.48 times larger than the volumes of the single alveoli as calculated from
data shown in Table 1 of Tschanz et al. (10) (day 4: 6.87e5 μm3 , day 10: 4.52e5 μm3 , day 21 4.45e5 μm3
and day 60 1.05e6 μm3 ), but scale equally during postnatal lung development. Tschanz et al. estimated
the total alveolar volume without the alveolar ducts. Since we directly estimated the volume fraction of
the alveoli per acinus our number is actually expected to be larger.

### Physiological relevance of the acinar size

It has been predicted by computational ﬂuid dynamics simulations and by to-scale experiments that the
amount and location of massless particle deposition, as well as ventilation are depending on the size
of the acini. The predictions could be confirmed at least in one case, where mice received ﬂuorescent
particles during mechanical ventilation. In 3D-visualizations the particles were predominately detected
in the proximal half of the acini (52).

Based on the above-mentioned knowledge and the data of this study, we propose the following. In very
small acini as the smallest ones we observed at postnatal day 4 acinar ﬂows are mainly characterized
by radial streamlines. Massless particle deposition is governed by diﬀusion (53). As the acini increase
in size, convective transport becomes more and more dominant in the proximal regions of the acini.
In larger acini, the proximal region shows a much higher particle retention than the distal once. The
proximal regions may even be viewed analogous to a filter capturing the particles whereas the distal
regions do not receive significant amounts (14; 16; 54).

Multi-breath gas-washout is also dependent on the size of the acini. Based on computational simulations
of nitrogen multi-breath gas-washout it has been shown that small acini washout faster at the beginning
and slower at the end of the washout as compared to larger acini (15). Not surprisingly, the distribution of
the acinar sizes in terms of their range has also an inﬂuence on the gas-washout. Furthermore, a clustering
versus an even distribution of the locations of acinar similar sizes eﬀects gas-washout. Therefore, the
question where an acinus of which size is located in the lungs has a significant inﬂuence on pulmonary
ventilation and particle deposition.

The larger distribution of the acinar sizes at day 4 as compared to day 60 let us speculate what this
may mean biologically. Physiologically, a larger distribution implies a less homogeneous ventilation and
an increased gas-washout time. Therefore, the decrease of the inhomogeneity of the acinar sizes may be
understood as an optimization of gas-exchange in adult animals.

The consideration of the location is not only a theoretical consideration, because it has been shown in
adult mice that the acini close to the pleura are larger than central ones (21). Therefore, acini of different
size are not evenly distributed in the lungs.

To our best knowledge, very few data characterizing acinar properties was available up to now. This is
especially true for lung development. Therefore, the data of the hereby presented study can contribute
to the improvements of computational simulations of pulmonary ventilation and particle deposition.
