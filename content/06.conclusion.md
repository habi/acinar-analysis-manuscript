## Conclusion

We conclude that our method is well suited to efficiently extract precise qualitative and quantitative values of large amounts of single acini from non-destructive three-dimensional tomographic data sets.
The underlying stereological analysis can be efficiently performed on tomographic data sets, the analysis of the stereological data was performed in a reproducible manner.
Besides, our method enabled us to maximize the number of investigations per sample, thus reducing the number of sacriÔ¨Åced animals.
We conclude that newly formed acini show a large size distribution which is reduced by a factor of 7 until adulthood.
Most likely the latter leads to a more homogeneous ventilation of the lung and an increase of gas-washout which is equal to a decreased in the number of breaths needed for gas-washout.
