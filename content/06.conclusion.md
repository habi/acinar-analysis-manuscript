## Conclusion

Newly formed acini show a large size distribution which is reduced by a factor of 7 until adulthood.
Most likely the latter leads to more homogeneous ventilation of the lung and an increase of gas-washout which is equal to a decreased in the number of breaths needed for gas-washout.

To our best knowledge, no in-depth characterization of the acinar properties as presented here---i.e.Â spanning the lung development period---was available up to now.
Even though our results are not precisely accordant with data calculated from previous studies, they match well, found differences are discussed extensively.

The data presented in this study can contribute to improve computational simulations of pulmonary ventilation and particle deposition.
