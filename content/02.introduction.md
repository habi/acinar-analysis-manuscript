## Introduction
### Lung development

Lung development starts with the formation of the two lung buds. During the embryonic stage (prenatal
days E11-E13 in rats) the major airways and the pleura are formed. During the pseudoglandular stage
(E13-E18.5) most of the remaining airway generations are formed by branching morphogenesis. Few
additional branches are added during the canalicular (E18.5 - E20) and maybe the saccular stage (E20
to postnatal day P4). Epithelial differentiation becomes morphologically visible during the canalicular
stage. Together with angiogenetic activation of the capillaries, this process leads to the ﬁrst functional
air-blood barriers in the lung.
The saccular stage represents an intermediate stage where branching morphogenesis ceases and the
developmental program switches to the phase of alveolarization. During alveolarization, 90 % of the adult
gas-exchange area is formed by the lifting oﬀ of new septa from the existing gas-exchange surface (1; 2; 3).
Alveolarization itself is divided into two distinct phases, the so-called classical (P4-P21) and continued
alveolarization (P14 to approximately P60).
During classical alveolarization, new septa are formed starting from preexisting immature septa which
contain a double-layered capillary network. During alveolarization, the structure of the alveolar septa
is changed to increase the efficiency of the lung. It includes the transformation of the double-layered
capillary network into a single-layered one. As a consequence, angiogenesis is necessary at the basis of the
newly forming septa. To distinguish these modes of the formation of new alveolar septa and to specify
that alveolarization continues after classical alveolarization ceased, the second phase of alveolarization
is called continued alveolarization. Here, the timing of lung development is given for rats while the same
stages and developmental mechanisms are observed in every placentalian species studied so far, including
humans. However, the timing of lung development and especially the time point of birth relative to lung
development is adapted in each species (3; 4; 5).

### The functional lung units

Pulmonary acini represent the gas-exchanging units of the bronchial tree and are deﬁned as the airways
distal of the terminal bronchioles (6). In humans, the acini contain approximately four generations
of respiratory bronchioles before reaching the alveolar ducts. The alveolar ducts start at the so-called
bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) where the lining of the inner airway surface abruptly changes
from the cuboidal epithelium of the bronchioles into type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelium which covers
the alveoli. The small tree of airways distal of the BADJ is called a ventilatory unit (7). Since murine
lungs do not possess respiratory bronchioles, the murine acini consist of one single ventilatory unit (7).
In this study we used rat lungs; hence we exclusively speak of acini. To translate our results to humans,
monkeys, or dogs, one would have to compare a rat acinus to a single ventilatory unit in these species.
Developmentally, the BADJ is of particular interest. The junction is formed during the canalicular stage
when the epithelia are differentiating. Ciliated epithelia containing goblet or club cells form proximal
and type I and II alveolar epithelia form distal of the BADJ. The BADJ is home to various stem cells (7).
The generation of the airway in which an individual murine acinus starts is deﬁned during the canalicular
stage and remains constant once it is formed. As a consequence, the number of formed acini also remains
constant during the phase of alveolarization and thereafter (8; 9). The latter was somehow surprising
because the total lung volume increases by roughly a factor of 10 during alveolarization (10). Therefore,
the mean volume of the acini has to increase by approximately the same factor. Since the acinus volume
can easily be estimated with the Cavalieri principle (11), we can test if and how the acinus volume
increases during lung development.

However, besides the global numbers little is known about the range of the volume of individual acini
throughout lung development. The latter represents a physiological signiﬁcant value, because it has been
shown by pulmonary particle deposition (12; 13; 10) and by computational ﬂuid dynamics simulations
of airﬂow (14; 15; 16) that the acinar architecture is important for ventilation and particle deposition.
However, due to the lack of measured data, these simulations are based on acinar models. Therefore, the
question of how well these models represent lung physiology remains open until the necessary data and
physiologically correct models are available. To contribute to the validation of the computational ﬂuid
dynamics simulations, we determined the volume and number of alveoli in individual acini throughout
rat lung development.

### Acinus detection and delineation

To detect and delineate individual acini, three-dimensional information is needed. On single two-dimensional
(histological) sections it is not possible to unambiguously detect which parts of the airways
and alveoli in the lung parenchyma are connected three-dimensionally. Historically, single or very few
acini were delineated and extracted from manually traced serial sections (17; 18) or sectioned silicone
casts (19), both with considerable manual work. Non-destructive three-dimensional imaging is best
suited to acquire data sets that can be used to easily detect, delineate and study large amounts of single
acini. This has been shown by Vasilescu et al. (20). In their study, they reconstructed 22 mouse acini
from tomographic data sets of four 12 week old mice (at least postnatal day 84, fully developed lungs)
and compared those with scanning electron microscope images of acinar silicone rubber casts. Similarly,
Kizhakke Puliyakote et al. (21) analyzed the volume of 32 mouse acini from six animals, as well as the
branching pattern of their internal airways. All prior work known to us has analyzed considerably fewer
acini than the 268 acini presented in this manuscript and - due to the study design - focuses only on one
time point, where the lungs of the animals are already fully developed while we are wable to analyze the
acini over the course of postnatal lung development.

The hereby presented method is well adapted to thoroughly analyze large amounts of acini in a time-efficient manner.
The largest part of the work is spent on the detailed stereological analysis of the
extracted acini. The method makes it possible to provide data spanning relevant parts of the lung development in animals.
As conﬁrmed by Vasilescu et al. (22), stereologically analyzing microtomographic
data provides quantitative information on internal structures of the lung while preserving the samples
for further studies.
