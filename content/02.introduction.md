## Introduction
### Lung development

Lung development starts with the formation of the two lung buds.
During the embryonic stage (prenatal days E11&ndash;E13 in rats) the major airways and the pleura are formed.
During the pseudoglandular stage (E13&ndash;E18.5) most of the remaining airway generations are formed by branching morphogenesis.
Only few additional branches are added during the later stages (canalicular (E18.5&ndash;E20) and (E20 to postnatal day P4)) [@schittny2007development].
Epithelial differentiation during the canalicular stage and angiogenetic activation of the capillaries lead to the first functional air-blood barriers in the lung [@Schittny_2018].
The saccular stage represents an intermediate stage where branching morphogenesis ceases and the developmental program switches to the phase of alveolarization.
During alveolarization, 90 % of the adult gas-exchange area is formed by lifting off new septa from the existing gas-exchange surface [@Burri_1974; @Kauffman_1974; @Schittny_2017].
Alveolarization itself is divided into two distinct phases, the so-called classical (P4&ndash;P21) and continued alveolarization (P14 to approximately P60) [@Tschanz_2014; @Schittny_2008].
During classical alveolarization, new septa are formed starting from preexisting immature septa which contain a double-layered capillary network.
During continued alveolarization, new septa are formed from preexisting mature septa.
In general, during alveolarization the structure of the alveolar septa is changed to increase the efficiency of the lung [@Tschanz_2014; @Schittny_2008].

Here, the timing of lung development is given for rats while the same stages and developmental mechanisms are observed in every placentalian species studied so far, including humans.
However, the timing of lung development and especially the time point of birth relative to lung development is adapted in each species [@Schittny_2017; @Schittny_2018; @Schittny_2008].

### The functional lung units

Pulmonary acini represent the gas-exchanging units of the bronchial tree and are defined as the airways distal of the terminal bronchioles [@Haefeli_Bleuer_1988].
In humans, the acini contain approximately four generations of respiratory bronchioles before reaching the alveolar ducts.
The alveolar ducts start at the so-called bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) where the lining of the inner airway surface abruptly changes from the cuboidal epithelium of the bronchioles into type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelium which covers the alveoli.
The small tree of airways distal of the BADJ is called a ventilatory unit [@Storey_1962].
Since murine lungs do not possess respiratory bronchioles, the murine acini consist of one single ventilatory unit [@Storey_1962].
In *this* study we used rat lungs; hence we exclusively speak of acini.
To translate our results to humans, monkeys, or dogs, one would have to compare a rat acinus to a single ventilatory unit in these species.

Developmentally, the BADJ is of particular interest.
The junction is formed during the canalicular stage when the epithelia are differentiating.
The generation of the airway in which an individual murine acinus starts is defined during the canalicular stage and remains constant once it is formed.
As a consequence, in rats the number of formed acini also remains constant during the phase of alveolarization and thereafter [@Barr__2016; @Barr__2014].
The latter was somehow surprising because in rats the total lung volume increases by roughly a factor of 10 during alveolarization [@Tschanz_2014].
Therefore, the mean volume of the acini has to increase by approximately the same factor.

However, besides the global numbers little is known about the range of the volume of individual acini throughout lung development.
The acinar architecture is important for ventilation, airflow [@Fishler_2015; @Hasler_2019; @Hofemeier_2014] and particle deposition [@Semmler_Behnke_2012; @Kreyling_2018; @Tschanz_2014].
However, due to the lack of measured data, simulations are based on relatively simple acinar models.
The question of how well these models represent lung physiology remains open until the necessary data and physiologically correct models are available.
To contribute to the validation of the computational fluid dynamics simulations, we extracted individual acini and determined their volume and their number of alveoli throughout rat lung development.

### Acinus detection and delineation

On single two-dimensional sections&mdash;either histological or virtual from tomographic imaging&mdash;it is not possible to unambiguously detect which parts of the airways and alveoli are connected three-dimensionally.
To detect and delineate individual acini the full three-dimensional information is needed.
Historically, single or very few acini were delineated and extracted from manually traced serial sections [@Mercer1987; @Woodward_2005] or sectioned silicone casts [@Rodriguez_1987] with considerable manual work.
Non-destructive three-dimensional imaging is best suited to acquire data sets that can be used to easily detect, delineate, and study large amounts of single acini.
This has been shown by Vasilescu et al. [@Vasilescu_2012a].
In their study, they reconstructed 22 mouse acini from tomographic data sets of four 12 weeks old mice (at least postnatal day 84, fully developed lungs) and compared those with scanning electron microscope images of acinar silicone rubber casts.
Similarly, Kizhakke Puliyakote et al. [@Kizhakke_Puliyakote_2016] analyzed the volume of 32 mouse acini from six animals, as well as the branching pattern of their internal airways.
All prior work known to us has analyzed considerably fewer acini than the 268 acini presented here and focuses only on a time point, at which the lungs of the animals are already fully developed while our data spans the postnatal days 4 to 60.

 We developed the hereby presented method to analyze large amounts of acini over the course of postnatal lung development in a time-efficient manner since no data on large amounts of acini is available up to now.
Our aim was to understand the size distribution of the acini during lung development including the contribution of the alveoli.
The observed range *de*creased during postnatal lung development by a factor of 6&ndash;7, which represents a completely unexpected result.
The obtained data are essential for further investigations, like the influence of the size of the acini on ventilation or gas-washout, respectively.
E.g., we are currently using our computational fluid dynamics model to simulate exactly this influence (own unpublished results and [@Hasler_2019]).
