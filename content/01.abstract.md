## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Pulmonary acini represent the functional gas-exchanging units of the lung.
Due to technical limitations, it is not possible to identify individual acini on microscopic lung sections.
We imaged instillation-ﬁxed rat lungs at postnatal days P4, P10, P21, and P60 to overcome these limitations.
Right lower lobes of these lungs were imaged at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source synchrotron facility at a voxel size of 1.48 μm.
Individual acini (N=268) were segmented from the 3D data by closing the airways ways at the transition point from conducting to gas exchanging airways.
Acinar development was followed by estimating the individual acinar volume, complexity, and number of alveoli.
The mean volume of the acini increases 23 times during the observed timeframe.
The coefficients of variation dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 and the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20 % smallest to the 20 % largest acini decreased from a factor of 27.26 (day 4) to a factor of 4.07 (day 60), i.e. shows a smaller dispersion at later time points.
This indicates that the acinar volumes show a very large variation at early timepoints and homogenize during maturation of the lung.
Our approach is well suited to follow acinar development and to acquire stereologically correct data in a time-efficient manner.
We found that the newly formed acini show a large size distribution which is reduced by a factor of 7 until adulthood.
Most likely this leads to a more homogeneous ventilation in the lung.
