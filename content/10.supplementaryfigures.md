![Plot of the mean acinar volumes.
  By dividing the parenchymal volumes of each lung estimated by Tschanz et al. (Table 1, (Tschanz 2014)) by the mean number of acini estimated by Barré et al. (9) we can estimate the mean acinar volume for each measured time point (blue plot).
  We assessed the volumes of the acini by point counting (Cavalieri estimation, orange plot). 
  Our volumes of the acini are on average 2.07 times lower but show a similar increase over the studied period. 
  While the estimation based on Tschanz et al. is from the entire right middle lobe and on Barré et al. globally for the whole organ, our estimation is solely based on the stereological analysis of the acini in the lower medial tip of the right lower lung lobe.](images/figs1.png){#fig:figs1}

![Plot of the estimated number of acini.
  The blue plot shows our estimation, based on the division of the parenchymal volume by the average volume of the acini.
  The orange plot is based on the data shown by Barre et al. (9; 8).](images/figs2.png){#fig:figs2}
